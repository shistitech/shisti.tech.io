                            below, that majority of firms are facing today: Lack of cultural balance and communication
                            between software Development and Operations Lack of agile delivery to drive software-driven
                            innovation Continued existence of silos between Development and Operations teams
                            Non-involvement of DBAs in release cycles, significantly hampering the inner circles Lack of

                            IAM Planning and Consulting Services
                            We believe that any Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution is only as effective as
                            the planning that supports it. The plan needs to focus on your immediate needs, but it
                            should also take you to where your company is heading. Simeio knows where you're heading
                            because we ask those kinds of questions. Our approach is “service first” and highly
                            flexible, so that we quickly get to the solution that makes the most sense to your company
                            and your customers.

                    <h3>IAM Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Identity and Access Management Strategy</p>
                    <p>
                        Most organizations approach identity and access management projects tactically, rather than
                        stepping back and determining a course of action that will solve enterprise-wide issues.
                        Starting
                        with a tactical approach is both short-sighted and high risk, leading to failed projects,
                        unnecessary expense, and the delay of beneficial results. A cohesive Identity Management
                        strategy provides a context for individual projects (e.g. user provisioning, directory
                        consolidation), which will then be seen as a supporting element of a unified plan that has
                        impact
                        at an enterprise level
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Key Activities/Deliverables:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Conduct business & technical stakeholder interviews</li>
                        <li> Identify & prioritize all identified IDM opportunities</li>
                        <li> Create phased approach to implement opportunities</li>

                    <h3>IAM Roadmap</h3>
                    <p>An Identity and Access Roadmap is developed in collaboration with the client based on current
                        state and the desired end state. This engagement is a lightweight version of a Strategy
                        engagement and will provide high-level recommendations around IAM systems/architecture and
                        existing provisioning processes. Lastly, the Road Map engagement will define a high level plan
                        for implementing short, mid, and long term IAM components that addresses both tactical and
                        strategic objectives.</p>

                    <h3>Access Governance</h3>
                    <p>
                        In today's world, regardless of method or geography, people expect to access data seamlessly.
                        The challenge is providing that access in a secure, reliable manner, and that is where IAM
                        governance comes in. The goal of access governance is to develop a framework that
                        incorporates standardized principles, prudent and responsible best practices, and a
                        multidisciplinary management model that respects the diverse nature of the organization. In
                        large and diverse communities, establishing centralized, overarching policies and standards is
                        critical to ensure consistency among many decentralized environments and the integrity of data.
                        A strong IAM system depends on a sustained commitment to administrative and technical
                        privacy and security controls.

                    <h3> Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want to improve your software delivery, build a culture of agility and automation,
                        accelerate software releases, and harness the power of the cloud, we can help. The first step is
                        to adopt a modern way of developing and releasing software by unifying software development
                        and IT operations, also called DevOps.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Current state assessment</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Roadmap and future state </li>
                        <li>Strategy, design, and implementation </li>

                    <h3> Start here: Building a DevOps culture</h3>

                    <p>

                        DevOps is more related to company culture than technological execution. As such, it requires a
                        complete overhaul of your company's organizational practices. Incomplete code testing and
                        deployment are replaced by more robust procedures. Teams that adopt a DevOps approach
                        help ingrain new practices and leadership goals.</p>
                    <p>
                        RTS Labs helps clients practice DevOps thinking right from the beginning. Our step-by-step
                        approach ensures that the entire team successfully migrates to the new dev + ops culture with
                        improved collaboration and accelerated deploy cycles. This results in a fast, secure, and agile
                        enterprise. It's a proven approach that always achieves results.</p>

                    <h3> Making the move to DevOps cloud computing </h3>
                    <p>
                        DevOps doesn't require your applications and services to be on the cloud, but it does enable
                        cloud computing and optimize for it. DevOps principles and practices directly address
                        challenges posed by the cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After moving to the cloud, the next logical step is deployed DevOps. Our experience has shown
                        that infrastructure involving DevOps poses the least risk when migrating data and helps ensure
                        that everything's in order.</p>
                    <p>
                        An all-inclusive process that asks for opinions from all stakeholders helps address the unique
                        challenges inherent to cloud infrastructure. Our team takes all stakeholder input into
                        consideration, whether it be about development, operations, testing, or information security.
                    </p>
                    <h3> DevOps automation consulting </h3>
                    <p>
                        DevOps uses automation to get things done. Automation tools are redundant and inefficient
                        without proper implementation, and that's where our team comes in. We consider your goals
                        and align those goals with automation to reduce errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Automation can be included at various points in the development, deployment, and monitoring
                        cycle:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Developing code </li>
                        <li>Testing and verifying code</li>
                        <li>Creating a test environment and infrastructure</li>
                        <li> Successfully deploying code</li>
                        <li> Data collection</li>
                        <li> Creating security notifications</li>
                        <li> Executing the entire DevOps pipeline</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> Agile methodology + DevOps</h3>
                    <p>
                        Agile (the de facto standard in software development) and DevOps are a natural pairing.</p>
                    <p>DevOps is often called an evolution from Agile, because they complement each other. Shorter
                        development cycles and feedback acquisition are major benefits of both systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>With us, you can build an Agile framework that will increase overall efficiency by modernizing
                        your operations, your team, and your process.</p>

                    <h3> DevOps &amp; security</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most providers don't adhere to strict standards that characterize DevOps development.
                        Such developments are likely to face security issues. We ensure that everything's in place and
                        that all protocols are followed.</p>
